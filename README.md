Installing
========
Make sure you got a MongoDB server running, and you've installed Node.js.
Git clone (or download the zip) this repository into a directory.

Edit `config.json` to your needs. Note the `publicIP` values; this IP is sent to the client on selecting character/changing channel!
Run the following command to install the required modules:
```
npm install
```
Then, run the server using the following command:
```
node maplejs
```

The server should be ready to use now.
